	DIY Custom BLE KeyBoard using nRF52840 controller 
</h3>




  
## 📝 Overview

This project is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) HID Keyboard built using the Nordic nRF52 series (tested on nRF52840 Dongle). 
It enables wireless communication with computers, smartphones, or any BLE-compatible host by emulating a standard HID keyboard.

Whether you're building a custom input device, a wireless macro pad, or experimenting with BLE HID profiles, this firmware provides
a lightweight, modular foundation to get started quickly.

Platform used for firmware development is nRF Connect SDK on VSCode.
